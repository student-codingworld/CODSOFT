This repository contains a collection of projects I completed during my internship at CODSOFT COMPANY. These projects showcase my skills in Python programming and include the following applications:

@ Calculator: A simple yet functional calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

@ To-Do List: A task management application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and productive.

@ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: A fun, interactive command-line game where users can play the classic rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

@ Password Generator: A secure password generator program that creates random and strong passwords based on user-specified criteria, enhancing online security.

Each project in this repository demonstrates my ability to apply Python programming concepts to solve practical problems and build user-friendly applications. This internship experience at CODSOFT has been instrumental in enhancing my coding skills and understanding of software development practices.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
